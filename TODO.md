### Not sure if I'll add this stuff:

0. **notifications**
| message | notifiable_id | notifiable_type
a.k.a
| message | follow_id | Follow
| message | member_request_id | member_request 

these are triggered by other events
aka
when someone clicks the follow button on you:
message = "User.name is now following you."
^^ how do I get their id

| The Kluggs just made new show | follow_id | follow

###
* SOCIAL STUFF - join tables

0. follows << polymorphic >>
| follower_id | followable_id | followable_type
aka
| mickey's id | 3 | user
| 3 | 8 | band
0. **user_follows** 
0. **band_follows**
0. **venue_follows**
0. **event_follows**


0. **event_attendances**
| event_id | attendee_id |
